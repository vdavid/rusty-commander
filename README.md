## Overview

Cmdr is a desktop file manager that brings back the classic two-pane layout. It's built for speed and keyboard
navigation. If you've ever used Norton Commander, Midnight Commander, or Total Commander, you'll feel right at home.

Core features:

- **Two-pane layout**: see two directories side by side
- **Keyboard-first navigation**: do everything without touching your mouse
- **Fast file operations**: copy, move, rename, and delete with a few keystrokes
- **Cross-platform**: runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Installation

## Usage

Launch Cmdr and start navigating:

| Key     | Action               |
| ------- | -------------------- |

| `↑` `↓` | Navigate files       |

## Tech stack

Cmdr is built with **Rust** and **Tauri** for the backend, and **Svelte** with **TypeScript** for the frontend. This
gives it native performance with a modern, responsive UI.

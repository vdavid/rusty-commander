# Rusty Commander

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/vdavid/rusty-commander)

An extremely fast, keyboard-driven, two-pane file manager written in Rust for folks who miss the golden days of Norton
Commander and Total Commander.

## Overview

Rusty Commander is a desktop file manager that brings back the classic two-pane layout. It's built for speed and
keyboard navigation. If you've ever used Norton Commander, Midnight Commander, or Total Commander, you'll feel right at
home.

Core features:

- **Two-pane layout**: see two directories side by side
- **Keyboard-first navigation**: do everything without touching your mouse
- **Fast file operations**: copy, move, rename, and delete with a few keystrokes
- **Cross-platform**: runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux

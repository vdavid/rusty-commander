    <p>
        Welcome to Cmdr! These terms govern your use of Cmdr, the desktop file manager application. By downloading,
        installing, or using Cmdr, you agree to these terms.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
            <strong>The short version:</strong> Cmdr is open source (AGPL-3.0). You can view, modify, and compile the source
            code. The official signed binary includes a 14-day trial, after which a $29 license is required. Be nice, don't
            abuse the system, and we'll all get along great.
        </p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
        Cmdr is developed and operated by <strong>Rymdskottkärra AB</strong>, a company registered in Sweden, located at
        Vattmyragränd 47, 177 39 Järfälla, Sweden.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>2. The software and its license</h2>

    <h3>Open source code</h3>
    <p>
        Cmdr's source code is licensed under the
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)</a
        >. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can view, study, and modify the source code</li>
        <li>You can compile and run the software yourself without purchasing a license</li>
        <li>Any modifications you distribute must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Official binary distribution</h3>
    <p>
        The official Cmdr binary (the signed and notarized macOS app) is what you're paying for when you purchase a
        license. It includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A 14-day free trial with full functionality</li>
        <li>After the trial, a $29 one-time license purchase is required</li>
        <li>Code signing and notarization (no macOS Gatekeeper warnings)</li>
        <li>Automatic updates</li>
        <li>Lifetime access to all future versions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What the license grants you</h3>
    <p>When you purchase a Cmdr license, you receive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A personal, non-transferable license to use Cmdr</li>
        <li>The right to install Cmdr on up to two machines you own</li>
        <li>All future updates at no additional cost</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Redistribute the official signed Cmdr binary commercially or claim it as your own product</li>
        <li>
            Circumvent or tamper with the licensing system in the official binary (note: per AGPL, you <em>can</em> modify
            the source code and compile your own version — that's different)
        </li>
        <li>Use Cmdr for any illegal activities</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse engineer our license key signing infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These restrictions exist to protect the sustainability of the project. We're a small team, and license revenue
        keeps Cmdr alive.
    </p>

    <h2>4. AI features disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Cmdr includes AI-powered features (such as natural language file renaming and search). Please be aware:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            AI features are <strong>non-deterministic</strong> — results may vary and aren't guaranteed to be accurate
        </li>
        <li>You are responsible for reviewing and confirming any file operations suggested by AI</li>
        <li>We recommend previewing changes before applying them, especially for bulk operations</li>
        <li>Cmdr is not liable for data loss resulting from AI-suggested operations you confirm</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Payment and refunds</h2>
    <p>
        Payments are processed by
        <a href="https://paddle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle</a>, our Merchant of Record.

    <p>
        We offer a <strong>30-day, no-questions-asked refund policy</strong>. See our <a href="/refund">Refund policy</a
        > for details.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p>Cmdr is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We don't guarantee that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The software will be error-free or uninterrupted</li>
        <li>All features will work on all systems</li>
        <li>The software will meet your specific requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Rymdskottkärra AB shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
        special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of data, arising from your use of Cmdr.
    </p>
    <p>Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for your Cmdr license.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these terms from time to time. We'll notify you of significant changes via email (if you've
        purchased a license) or by posting a notice on our website.
    </p>
    <p>Continued use of Cmdr after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing law</h2>
    <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of Sweden. Any disputes shall be resolved in Swedish courts. However,
        nothing in these terms limits your statutory consumer rights under EU law.
    </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The short version:</strong> 30 days, no questions asked. If Cmdr isn't for you, we'll refund your purchase.
            Simple as that.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Our policy</h2>
    <p>
        We offer a <strong>30-day, no-questions-asked refund</strong> on all Cmdr license purchases. If you're not happy with
        Cmdr for any reason, you can request a full refund within 30 days of your purchase.
    </p>
    <p>You don't need to justify it. We get it — sometimes software just isn't the right fit.</p>

    <h2>How to request a refund</h2>
    <p>
        Refunds are handled by <strong>Paddle</strong>, our payment processor. You have two options:
    </p>

    <h3>Option 1: Through your Paddle receipt</h3>
    <p>
        Check your email for the receipt from Paddle. Click the "Request refund" link in that email. Paddle will process
        it automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Option 2: Contact us directly</h3>
    <p>
        Email us at <a href="mailto:legal@getcmdr.com">legal@getcmdr.com</a>
        with your order number or the email you used for purchase. We'll initiate the refund through Paddle.
    </p>

    <h2>What happens next</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Refunds typically process within 5-10 business days</li>
        <li>The refund goes back to your original payment method</li>
        <li>Your license key will be deactivated after the refund is processed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why we offer this</h2>
    <p>
        We believe in Cmdr. We also know that a 14-day trial might not be enough to fully evaluate a file manager that
        you'll use every day. The 30-day refund period gives you peace of mind — buy it, use it for real work, and if
        it's not working out, no hard feelings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect it.
        We've tried to keep it readable — no walls of legalese.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
            <strong>The short version:</strong> We collect minimal data. The website uses analytics and collects your email
            if you subscribe. The app validates your license using a machine identifier. We don't sell your data. Ever.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Rymdskottkärra AB</strong> (the "data controller") is responsible for your personal data. We're a Swedish
        company located at:
    </p>
    <p>
        Vattmyragränd 47<br />
        177 39 Järfälla<br />
        Sweden
    </p>
    <p>
        For privacy-related questions, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:legal@getcmdr.com">legal@getcmdr.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>

    <h3>On the website (getcmdr.com)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Email address</strong> — if you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics data</strong> — we use PostHog to understand how visitors use our website. This includes pages
            visited, referrer, browser type, and approximate location (country level). PostHog may set cookies for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Payment information</strong> — if you purchase a license, payment is handled by Paddle. We receive your
            email and purchase details, but not your credit card number.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>In the desktop app</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Machine identifier</strong> — when validating your license, we generate a pseudonymous machine ID to prevent
            license sharing across too many devices. This ID doesn't identify you personally.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>License key</strong> — stored locally on your machine. We verify it cryptographically without contacting
            our servers for every check.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What we don't collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>File names, contents, or any data from your file system</li>
        <li>Keystrokes, screenshots, or usage patterns within the app</li>
        <li>Personal files or documents</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Why we collect this data (legal basis)</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR, we need a legal basis for processing your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Contract performance</strong> — machine ID for license validation (you need it to use the software you
            purchased)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interest</strong> — analytics to improve our website and product, fraud prevention
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Consent</strong> — newsletter emails (you can unsubscribe anytime)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How we use your data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To deliver and improve Cmdr</li>
        <li>To process your license purchase</li>
        <li>To send you product updates (if you subscribed)</li>
        <li>To respond to your support requests</li>
        <li>To analyze website traffic and improve our marketing</li>
    </ul>

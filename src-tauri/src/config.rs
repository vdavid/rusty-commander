// MCP Server Security Design:
// --------------------------
// The MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge allows AI assistants to control the app.
// This requires `withGlobalTauri: true` which exposes `window.__TAURI__` to the frontend.
//
// To prevent this security risk in production:
// 1. The MCP plugin is only registered in debug builds (see lib.rs: #[cfg(debug_assertions)])
// 2. `withGlobalTauri` is only enabled via tauri.dev.json (merged in dev only by tauri-wrapper.js)
// 3. Production builds use tauri.conf.json which has `withGlobalTauri: false`
//
// See CONTRIBUTING.md for setup instructions.

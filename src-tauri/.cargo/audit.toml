    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack in rsa crate (timing sidechannel)
    # Status: No fix available (as of 2026-01)
    # This comes from: smb -> sspi -> rsa (and picky -> rsa)
    # The smb crate is required for SMB network share functionality.
    # The rsa crate still uses a non-constant-time implementation.
    # Risk mitigation: This vulnerability requires network-observable timing
    # information to exploit. Our SMB usage is for local file management,
    # not handling sensitive cryptographic operations where timing attacks
    # would be practical.
    # TODO: Remove this ignore when sspi updates to a fixed rsa version.

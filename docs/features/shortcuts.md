| `⌥↑`     | Jump to first item (Home) | Both |
| `⌥↓`     | Jump to last item (End)   | Both |

| `Fn→`    | Jump to last item (End)   | Both |
| `Fn↑`    | Page up                   | Both |
| `Fn↓`    | Page down                 | Both |

**Note**: On macOS, `Fn+Arrow` keys generate `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, and `PageDown` key events.

### Pane navigation

| Shortcut | Action                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Tab`    | Switch between left and right panes |

## Notes

- **Brief mode**: The file list is displayed in multiple columns. Arrow keys navigate within and between columns.
    - Page Up/Down: Moves horizontally by (number of visible columns - 1) and jumps to the bottommost item in the target
      column. If the target would be at or past the leftmost/rightmost edge, it jumps to the first/last item instead.
      This allows quick navigation across large file sets while maintaining context.
- **Full mode**: The file list is displayed in a single column with detailed metadata (size, date). Only up/down arrow
  keys navigate items; left/right arrows are not used.
    - Page Up/Down: Moves vertically by (number of visible items - 1), adapting to the current window size.
- All jump shortcuts (Home/End) work consistently in both Brief and Full modes.
